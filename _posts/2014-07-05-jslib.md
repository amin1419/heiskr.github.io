title: Common.js JavaScript Library for the Browser
---

One of my thoughts while working as a client (front end, user interface) engineer is that we have so many libraries. In fact, there's a great deal of overlap. Even when using something like Node.js or jQuery, there's going to be a great deal of overlap. Also, you as of right now have to include the whole library to get any of the functionality.

But now that we have things like common.js and Browserify, there really isn't a need for this anymore. It's time to question some of our assumptions.

Node.js itself provides some pretty great packages, many of which are usable by the front-end: events, stream, path, url, assert, buffer, util, querystring, http, vm, and crypto currently.

What if we added to this and built a fully modular client library to include the capabilities of things like jQuery, underscore.js, and Backbone?

- Events (Extended for the client-side)
- Ajax
- DOM Elements
    - Selectors
    - Attributes
        - Data
        - Styling
        - Forms
    - Animation
- Promises
- Feature Detection
- Dates and times
- Collection Functional
- Function Utilities
- Type testing
- Models
- Collections
- Routers
- Views

And if we broke it down so we could include a whole module or even just a single function and its dependencies, we would be able to build smaller, leaner frontends using more modular and less overlapping code.

Thoughts? Let me know in the comments!
