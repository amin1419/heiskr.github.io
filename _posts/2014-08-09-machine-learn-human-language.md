title: Machine Learning to build a Human Language
---

I had a pretty crazy idea a few days ago, a synthesis of other ideas I've had. Let's start with the sources:

1. I've named some of my more artsy projects over the years using [Esperanto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), a old constructed language. Esperanto, and its derivatives, have some very cool properties. The language has a completely regular, simple grammar and all words are constructed from a few core roots.
2. I'm interested in machine learning. I'm (slowly) working on an online learning platform, [Sagefy](http://sagefy.org) that will use machine learning extensively.
3. I have some interest in the syntactical design of [programming languages](/2014/06/24/garden/).
4. I recently participated in the [BIC Universal Typeface](http://www.theuniversaltypeface.com) project, which is using averaging to create the most averaged handwriting in the world.
5. [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) offers a language learning course, which was based on trying to translate the web and teach languages at the same time.

In this concept, we could essentially turn the BIC and Duolingo models upside down. What if instead of trying to change the human to the language, what if we change the language to the human?

Machine learning algorithms try to reduce error. What if instead of this error being a prediction error, it was instead the error a human makes trying to learn a language. Now we're talking about building a language that inheritly makes sense to humans while minimizing the cognitive difficulty of learning the language.

Rather than trying to guess at the properties of an easy to learn language, we could have algorithms try to find what those properties are automatically. Cool, right?

You'd probably want to start by finding base syllables that all people can identify with particular meanings, such as [this example](http://youtu.be/2cU56SWXHFw?t=3m15s). From there, you would build the vocabulary, then the grammar, and just continue to learn from humans until the error rate is sufficiently low.

Questions, comments, elaborations? Let me know in the comments below!
