title: Design Checklist
---

Over the years I've learned a few tricks about user interface design. Not all of these apply in all scenarios. And as always, a quick usability test will tell you more than any guidelines ever could.

Consider this list a work-in-progress. I will likely make continuing edits.

Language
--------

- [ ] Name everything.
- [ ] Use the smallest words without losing meaning.
- [ ] Use the fewest words without losing meaning.
- [ ] Use positive words.
    - Say 'show', 'enable', 'allow'; avoid 'not', 'hide', 'disable', 'limit'...
- [ ] Use active voice.
- [ ] Use imperative form.
- [ ] Say "thank you" at every opportunity.
- [ ] Use nouns instead of pronouns.
- [ ] On errors...
    1. Apologize.
    2. State the action that caused the issue.
    3. Explain the issue.
    4. Say what to do next.
- [ ] Treat the user as the expert.
- [ ] Focus on benefits over features.
- [ ] Use a diagram, flowchart, or simple drawing.

Layout
------

- [ ] Create a style guide, listing _every_ feature.
- [ ] Update the style guide with every design change.
- [ ] Use one column unless there's no way around it.
- [ ] Start with the mobile use case first. Then expand out.
- [ ] Establish hierarchy.

Components
----------

- [ ] Show component states to the user.
- [ ] Establish hierarchy.

Forms
-----

- [ ] Suggest input length by varying form field length.
- [ ] Break up forms into groups of three to five fields.
- [ ] Keep processes linear.
- [ ] Use the least number of fields required.
- [ ] Skip confirmation fields.
- [ ] Label every field consistently.
- [ ] Say if the field is required or optional.
- [ ] Provide inline validation messages.
- [ ] Keep visual changes near where the user is looking.
- [ ] Always persist form data.
- [ ] Show an example of input on complex fields.
- [ ] Adjust presentation based on the number of options.
- [ ] Make users do less work. Use already known information.
- [ ] Provide default selections.
- [ ] Tell the user what you are going to do with the information.
- [ ] Use specific verbs in buttons.
- [ ] Always have one primary action, and emphasize it.
- [ ] Only use one column of fields.
- [ ] Add icons, but skip the graphics and animations.
- [ ] Don't rely on hue alone.

Research and Testing
--------------------

- [ ] Identify the business objectives.
- [ ] Get 10-20 users to fill out a brief survey.
- [ ] Write down the user's:
    - Goal
    - Expectations
    - Resources
    - Motivation
    - Attitude
- [ ] Watch at least five people use the design.
- [ ] Conduct a card sort to find out organization.
- [ ] Test your wireframes.
- [ ] Run through existing heuristics.
- [ ] Establish metrics before changes.
- [ ] Observe changes in metrics with design.

Psychology
----------

- [ ] Everyone makes the same mistakes.
- [ ] Observe user behaviors. Design is not about preferences.
    - Avoid "like", "should", "can't", "busy", and "need".
- [ ] Support internal motivation. Avoid external reward and punishment.
- [ ] Decide based on user behavior.
- [ ] Research user opinions before making changes.
- [ ] Combine, remove, simplify, and generalize to avoid feature creep.

----

- [ ] Include a privacy policy.
- [ ] Have a single, clear call-to-action per page.
- [ ] Use multiple ways to convey information, not relying only on color.
- [ ] Consistent navigation on every page.
- [ ] Links should start with a verb. No 'click here'.
- [ ] Most important content should be displayed first.
- [ ] Responsive with no horizontal scrolling.
- [ ] Avoid pop-ups and modals.
- [ ] Consider error states.
- [ ] Show errors in relevant places, not in one place.
