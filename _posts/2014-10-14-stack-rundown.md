title: Application Stack Rundown
---

One of the challenges I faced while deciding on the Sagefy tech stack was finding both what _types_ of tools I needed and what _options_ were available, given previous technical choices. It's still an ongoing discussion in my head.

What if we had a little static site that had a database of different tools available by category? The interface would present the developer with a series of choices, starting with the biggest questions like languages, before going down into testing frameworks and object-relational mappers. Each option would provide links so the developer could research each option as needed.

The results could be saved, and perhaps another project could read those choices and automatically setup a new repository for the developer with that technical stack ready to go.

Here's some examples of possible categories.
