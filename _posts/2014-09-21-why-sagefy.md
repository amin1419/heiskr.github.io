title: Why I'm Building Sagefy
---

Back when I was an undergraduate student, I had a seed of an idea. As time has gone on, and the more I've learned and read on the subject, the more fleshed out the idea became. In April of last year, I explained this idea to a close friend of mine, who asked me, "What's stopping you from doing this?" Since then, I've been (slowly) building my dream app.

My problem is that learning in the classroom model is often very slow, unchallenging, and no one remembers much of what they learned after the class is over. There's a huge disconnect in how the system expects people learn, and how people actually learn.

The traditional classroom model: the teacher lectures information, the students do reading, practice questions, and assignments with the material. Finally, students take an exam to show what they've learned.

I just don't think it really works the way it's intended. No one memorizes anything the second they hear it. It takes practice and rehearsal to remember things.

And simply knowing facts doesn't mean you can _do_ anything with those facts. It's one thing to know something, but to be able to relate it to other information or to apply it to a real-world scenario? It's rare the system ever addresses applying knowledge.

The system also mostly doesn't account for prior knowledge. We know from learning science that prior knowledge is extremely important. But the system lumps big groups of people together, and hopes every student can just magically fill in the gaps, and that they will not be bored when being presented with something they already know. It doesn't work.

Retention is another major issue. The system says, here's your grade, now you know this subject forever. But it doesn't work that way. We forget things. We need refreshers. And especially if all we did is memorize, our chances at long-term memory are very slim.

The current system has a huge agenda, wanting to teach everyone everything there is to know. But we are limited. We can really only do one thing effectively at a time. Especially around middle school and high school, learners often are overwhelmed by the variety of information they are supposed to memorize, all just to forget it over the summer.

Maybe the greatest problem of all with the established system is just how long it takes to be considered 'educated'. And after which, most people don't have real-world job skills. How many of my friends have I seen finish a degree, and then struggle for years to develop in-demand skills? 26-plus years is too long to start a career.

We have more knowledge now as a society than we have ever had, and we have some  serious challenges ahead of us. Global warming, energy, water, technological change, population growth, healthcare, debt... All the more reasons for us to speed up this process.

I'm not the first person to come to these conclusions. By far. Everyone goes through the educational system, and we all have our own theories of learning.

There's a huge number of educational technology products out there. More than one can reasonably count. Each one tries to solve some of these challenges in different ways. More often than not, they come to fall back on the traditional model.

Let's talk about the current environment of educational products.

The most common are the learning management systems. These are like Blackboard or Moodle. There's so many LMSs out there, it's impossible to know all of them. While the technology can make things a little easier, this is still basically the traditional model in essence.

The big thing recently has been massively open online courses, or MOOCs. They allow anyone in the world to take courses, for free. The popular ones right now are Coursera, EdX, and Udemy. Most of the MOOCs are LMSs that allow anyone to take the classes for free, and don't really go beyond that model.

There's a few examples of MOOC-like platforms that do things a little differently. Udacity involves more practice, which is a plus, but still along the same lines. Duolingo focuses on languages, and uses gamification techniques. Khan Academy has a beautiful tree of knowledge, showing prerequisites easily, and again integrating practice heavily into the system. A few of the alternative MOOCs focus on problem-based learning instead of lecture-based, and that's a huge win too.

We then have flash-card based systems. There are lots of these. The great thing about the flash-card systems is they often use spaced repetition to promote forming long-term memory. However, they are often very limited in what you can learn with them. Think Anki or SuperMemo.

Adaptive learning systems, like ALEKS, Cognitive Tutor, and Knewton, are really inspiring. They account greatly for prior knowledge, and greatly speed up learning. The problem most have faced is low adoption, due to a limited amount of content. Also, the content tends to be limited to "right or wrong" types of subjects like algebra due to technical constraints.

There's also open-content systems, like Wikipedia or Quora. They have an amazing amount of content, and using a consensus-based decision making process, in one form or another, the content is actually pretty high quality. Of course, they are mostly in the business of making information available, and don't address learning directly.

Some of these systems are built using open-source technology, meaning anyone can contribute to the code. The result is that the code changes more quickly, adapts to user needs much faster, and the code is of much higher quality.

There's some really good ideas here. Each of these systems addresses at least one of the issues I mentioned above.

But it still isn't quite there yet, is it?

I've spend a good amount of time reading on learning science, neuroscience, studying alternative learning models, and building prototypes.

Sagefy hopes to combine the best of these systems, all while simplifying things a little. While each of the previous systems still show resemblance and usefulness to the traditional model, Sagefy will end up having very little in relation to the traditional model.

Sagefy is an open-content adaptive learning system. That's a mouthful. In essence, it combines the ideas from adaptive learning systems, such as ALEKS, Cognitive Tutor, or Knewton, with open-content systems, like Wikipedia.

I have quite a bit of documentation on the system and what my plans are, available at <http://docs.sagefy.org>.

I'm aware that building a learning system is hard work. It will likely take a few years just to get a minimally viable product together.

I will probably fail. Either I won't get an MVP, or I won't get people to adopt it. I'm okay with that.

I'm also aware that the traditional schooling system would be very unlikely to ever pick up a system like this. Teachers have requirements and regulations they have to meet. People dislike learning new technology, especially when it uses a totally different paradigm. The educational technology market is saturated. And schools don't always have access to the best technology.

So I probably won't get adoption by the school system at any level. That goes for corporate training as well. My best bet is learners who are intrinsically motivated and who want to learn things outside of the system, for free.

For me, the best thing I can do is get some ideas out there about how to account for how people really learn in a learning system. Even if I fail, I can demonstrate that an alternative is both possible and realistic. Of course, if Sagefy does succeed, even better.

This project has been a fun ride so far, and I hope it continues for many more years. If you're interested in learning more, have feedback, or want to get involved, let me know.
