  Muziko Kreito Universo is a three-dimensional visual and ambisonic sound installation. The work is experienced as a digital universe of intelligent musical creatures, where human participants act as gods controlling the environment as the creatures strive for auditory greatness. The work explores themes of creation and destruction, of power and servitude, and of the role of humans in an environment with other beings, as well as the fundamental relationship between the essence of sound and decision-making beings.
<p>The work was installed on April 19th and May 1st, 2010 in the University of Oregon School of Music, April 30th, 2010 in the University of Oregon Erb Memorial Union, and performed on May 8th, 2010 at the Future Music Oregon concert.
